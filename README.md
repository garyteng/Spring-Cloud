# Spring-Cloud with MySQL

## Goal
In this project, I use java Spring to crate some Rest API, and store the data in MySQL, and make both of them run on a single AWS t2.micro instance.

This is a small program that can be used to store daily notes from different users, and query notes by searching specific words.
